```sh
sudo bash ./script_hostapd.sh # to start the hotspot
docker compose up --build # build the docker of the IDS
```

## How to use ?
1. Scan devices connected to the access point in /hotspot/hotspot
    - scan is available with the button "Scan new devices"
    - once a device is detected, it is added to the database and shown on the connected device table
    - once a device has been scanned, it is being monitored and we can see in real-time (all 10 seconds) if his connection stopped 
2. Edit devices properties like name, vendor, model, version
3. Capture packets (live capture, number of packets or time-based)
